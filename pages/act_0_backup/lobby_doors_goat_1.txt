<title>M.O.G., Lobby<title>
<text>You open the door with the goat engraving. Behind it is a large room, filled with turf, and well lit.
There is a goat in the room. It is staring at you, chewing slowly.

There are some electrodes running from the goat to a dial mounted on the wall, with two ends labelled "HAPPY" and "SAD".
The dial is currently most of the way towards the "happy" end.<text>
