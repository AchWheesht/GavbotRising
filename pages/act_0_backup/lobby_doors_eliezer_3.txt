<title>M.O.G., behind the Elizer Yudkowsky door<title>
<text>You pace along the rows of gavs. Not one of them acknowleges your prescence - they all seem far too involved
with whatever it is they are writing about. You sneak a peek at the nearest Gav's work:

<i>"No, Ron!", said Harry. We can't save that hippogriff just because you like it! What if it escapes and kills someone?
Their death would be on our hands!</i>

Another's reads:

<i>...changed into a low-cut black floor-length dress with red lace all around it and black high heels. When I came out...
</br>Draco was standing in front of the bathroom, and he started to sing "I just wanna live" by Good Charlotte.
</br>AN: shjt up prepz ok! PS I wnot update ubtil u give me goood revows!</i>

A third:

<i>"Harry, I was absolutely justified in shooting Draco." said Hermione. "He blasphemed against the great Alex Salmond,
for which the only punishment is death".</i>

It would seems that every single Gav is writing Harry Potter Fanfiction.

Except...one piece of paper catches your eye. Stuck halfway into one of the wastepaper baskets there seems to be some sort
of drawing. Walking over to fish it out (the Gav, predictably, ignores you), you find it is a beautiful illustration of a garden
on a midsummer's eve. The bin is full of these drawings, some classical, some abstract. There is also poetry, and song,
and fiction not involving copyrighted characters.

Looking up, you notice that the seat next to the desk is now empty.

The door <i>clicks</i> shut behind you.<text>
