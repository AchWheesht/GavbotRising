<title>M.O.G., Lobby<title>
<text>You dive through the door right as it closes, landing in a heap on the floor as a loud <i>thud</i> cuts off your
access to the outside world.

Standing up, you find yourself in the lobby of the ministry of Gavin. It is surprisngly pleasant place, though everything
appears to have a newish feel to it, besides the floor, which has heavily worn tracks leading to and from every exit.

A receptionist sits behind a small desk in front of you. Human, oddly enough; receptionist work is normally left to the
Gavs nowadays. He's reading a copy of <i>Gavbot Monthly</i>, and apparently hasn't noticed you.
