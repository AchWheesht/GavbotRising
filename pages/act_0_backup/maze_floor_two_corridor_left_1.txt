<text>You open the door. Behind it sit a bunch of gavbots, currently idle. They seem to be doing typical
idle gavbot activities, like watching shitty cartoons, listning to punk music, or misunderstanding each other
trying to communicate basic facts.

They are all wearing the same mask that the bot next to the neon sign was wearing.<text>
