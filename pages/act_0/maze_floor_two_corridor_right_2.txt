<title>M.O.G., Second Floor<title>
<text>The room is thick with dust and cobwebs. Spiders scutter from wall to wall. In the center of the room is an ancient mahogany desk,
inscribed with eldritch runes from aeons past. Behind the desk sits a skeleton, bones dry and grey from years of neglect.

Very slowly, oh so very slowly, the skeleton turns towards you, and intones:

"Christ, its boring in here. Do you want to play a game? I'll roll these two dice, and for each time I don't roll 11, I'll kill you.
If you don't die, you can go through this door behind me. You in?"<text>
