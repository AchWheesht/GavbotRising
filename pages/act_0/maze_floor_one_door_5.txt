<text>You step into the doorway to check the hallway out.

Most of the feelings of terror and dread seem to have diminished, and the whispers can only be heard if you strain.
Although, they don't seem to be whispers any more. More like...laughter.

You notice that the corridor seems a little shorter than before.

In fact, you notice that the corridor is geting shorter quite quickly. The darkness is rushing towards you!

The laughing noise gets louder.<text>
