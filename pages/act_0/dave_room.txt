<title>M.O.G., Dave's Room<title>
<text>It only takes 5 minutes of flailing about for you to find the light switch. With a dull <i>thunk</i>, the lights
flicker on.

You are standing in one half of a room divided by a thick glass barrier. The half of the room you're standing is set up like
an orderly office. There's a few bookcases stuffed full of textbooks on Gav theory, a desk with a resonably modern desktop. In
the far corner, an old server sits by itself humming. There is a door marked "TRAINING ROOM" on your left, and a large red button
marked "BEGIN TRAINING" sits on a pedestal next to it.

The other half of the room, behind the glass, has bright white walls and contains exactly two features. Firstly, a "TRAINING
ROOM" door, similar to the one on your side. And secondly, there is a Gavbot huddling in the corner.<text>
