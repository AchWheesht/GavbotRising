<title>Outside the M.O.G.<title>
<text><b>QUIDQUID LATINE DICTUM SIT, ALTEM VIDETUR</b>

These words, carved in granite, stand atop the heavy wooden doors that stand before you. The doors themselves are covered with markings
which, although static, seem to constantly weave and shift into new pictures. These are the famed doors of the Ministry of Gavin,
the most prestigious and secretive organisation in Scotland, and your new place of employment.

Very little is known about what happens behind those gigantic, hallucinogenic doors. In fact, you don't even know yourself.
The job advert was simply a box that stated “Will pay for time and labour”, and the interview was a fifteen minute test with a
single question - “Explain...why?”. It wasn't even apparent that you would be working here until the job offer came through the
letterbox - a single piece of paper with the word "yes" stamped onto it.

That had been three weeks ago. In the interim, there had been no contact from the M.O.G. Well, technically, there had been some
contact – in response to an email asking what you were actually going to be doing at your job, you had received a blank card.

Standing here now, beneath the latin, you pause to consider your feelings. What thoughts are running through your mind?
How are you feeling right now?<text>
