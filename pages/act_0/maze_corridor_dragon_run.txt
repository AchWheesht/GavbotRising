<title>M.O.G., The Long Corridor<title>
<text>You muster all the remaining energy you have and sprint for the end of the corridor. You feel your muscles start to burn,
your bones start to ache, your lungs about to burst from the strain. Ever present behind you is the thumping of the dragon.

Suddenly, the corridor ends. You find yourself standing in front of a heavy steel door. On your left, a bored looking guard
sits at a desk.

There is nothing behind you any more.
