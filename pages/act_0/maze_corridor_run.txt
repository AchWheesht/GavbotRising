<title>M.O.G., The Long Corridor<title>
<text>Fuck this. You sprint as fast as you can towards the end of the corridor.

You get there suprisingly fast. Looking behind you, you can't see anything. Huh.

You find yourself standing in front of a heavy steel door. On your left, a bored looking guard
sits at a desk.<text>
