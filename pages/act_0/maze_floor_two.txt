<title>M.O.G, Floor Two<title>
<text>At the next floor, you are greeted by a flashing neon light proclaiming "WELCOME TO FLOOR TWO OF THE MINISTRY
OF GAVIN". There is a gavbot next to it, cheerfully waving at you. It has a photo of a smiling woman taped to its face.

Behind the gavbot is a short corridor, lined with doors.<text>
